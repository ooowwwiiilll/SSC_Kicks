## Story

This project is one of those "childhood" imaginations. 
I am a Basketball fan, especially NBA. I am also a sneakerhead. I've experience buying wrong shoes, only caring about aesthetic and not functionality. These leads me to getting injured when I am wearing that shoes into a basketball game. 

Hence I build KICKS. I want to educate non-sneakerheads the anatomy of a shoe and teach them the art & science from a footwear that correlated to performance. I am using Apple's amazing SceneKit to build the 3D scenes, and Blender to build the scene objects. I am also using SwiftUI, AVKit, & UIKit to craft stunning & engaging Audio + Visual combination. 

## Installation

1. Clone this project using your CLI of choice or download the zip.
2. Open KICKS.swiftpm in Xcode.
3. Choose iPad Pro 12.9-inch as the simulator and hit build.
Enjoy!

### KICKS will be available in the App Store soon. More fun & engaging features are under development. Stay tune.
